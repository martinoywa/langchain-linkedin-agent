    "Education and early life\n",
    "Karpathy was born in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia)[9][10][11][12] and moved with his family to Toronto when he was 15.[13] He completed his Computer Science and Physics bachelor's degrees at University of Toronto in 2009[14] and his master's degree at University of British Columbia in 2011,[14] where he worked on physically-simulated figures (for example, a simulated runner or a simulated person in a crowd) with his adviser Michiel van de Panne.\n",
    "\n",
    "Karpathy received a PhD from Stanford University in 2015 under the supervision of Fei-Fei Li, focusing on the intersection of natural language processing and computer vision, and deep learning models suited for this task.[15][16]\n",

    "Career and research\n",
    "He authored and was the primary instructor of the first deep learning course at Stanford, CS 231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.[17] It became one of the largest classes at Stanford, growing from 150 students in 2015 to 750 in 2017.[18]\n",
    "\n",
    "Karpathy is a founding member of the artificial intelligence research group OpenAI,[19][20] where he was a research scientist from 2015 to 2017.[18] In June 2017 he became Tesla's director of artificial intelligence and reported to Elon Musk.[21][7][22] He was named one of MIT Technology Review's Innovators Under 35 for 2020.[23] After taking a several months-long sabbatical from Tesla, he announced he was leaving the company in July 2022.[24] As of February 2023, he makes YouTube videos on how to create artificial neural networks.[25]\n",
