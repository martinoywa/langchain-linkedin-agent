    "Education and early life\n",
    "Karpathy was born in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia)[9][10][11][12] and moved with his family to Toronto when he was 15.[13] He completed his Computer Science and Physics bachelor's degrees at University of Toronto in 2009[14] and his master's degree at University of British Columbia in 2011,[14] where he worked on physically-simulated figures (for example, a simulated runner or a simulated person in a crowd) with his adviser Michiel van de Panne.\n",
    "\n",
    "Karpathy received a PhD from Stanford University in 2015 under the supervision of Fei-Fei Li, focusing on the intersection of natural language processing and computer vision, and deep learning models suited for this task.[15][16]\n",
